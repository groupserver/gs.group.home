  <h2>Group Homepage</h2>
  <p>
    A group homepage is divided into three sections: 
    <a href="#gs-group-home-usbar">the us bar</a>
    <a href="#gs-group-home-info">information tabs</a> and
    <a href="#gs-group-home-tasks">task tabs</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    What you can see on the homepage depends on the 
    <a href="#gs-group-help-privacy">privacy settings</a>
    of the group, whether you are logged in, and whether you are a
    member.
    The table below summaries the visibility of the different
    sections for different group privacy settings.
